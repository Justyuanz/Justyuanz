# 👋 Hi, I'm Yuan

I'm currently a student at **Hive Helsinki**, diving deep into low-level programming with C.

## Currently Working On

[`push_swap`](https://github.com/Justyuanz/push_swap) —  
Developing a sorting algorithm using only stack operations and a limited instruction set.  
The goal: sort data with as few moves as possible under strict constraints.

## Outside Code

When I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me:
- 🐾 Just chilling with my 🐶🐱
- 🚴 Cycling through Helsinki  
- 🛹 Skateboarding with friends  
- 🎸 Jamming to music  
- 🧶 Making handcrafted things like candles and macramé
